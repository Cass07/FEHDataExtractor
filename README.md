# FEHDataExtractor

A Data Extractor for FEH files. For now it supports:

Heroes (/Common/SRPG/Person)

Enemies (/Common/SRPG/Enemy)

Generic Text search in files (/Common/.*)

Grand Conquest Map Settings (/Common/Occupation/World)

Skills (/Common/SRPG/Skill)

Quests (/Common/Mission)

In the future it will support more things. Supports auto decompression.

Thanks to https://github.com/SciresM/FEAT and https://github.com/einstein95/dsdecmp for the base of the decompression code.
