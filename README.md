# FEHDataExtractor

A Data Extractor for FEH files. For now it supports:

Heroes (assets/Common/SRPG/Person)

Enemies (assets/Common/SRPG/Enemy)

Generic Text search in files (assets/Common/.*)

Grand Conquest Map Settings (assets/Common/Occupation/World)

Skills (assets/Common/SRPG/Skill)

Quests (assets/Common/Mission)

Tempest Trial (assets/Common/SRPG/SequentialMap) BETA!

Messages (assets/*/Message/**/*.bin)

To have translated output, use the menu option Load -> Messages and choose the folder with the language of choice. If all goes well, the output will be translated.

In the future it will support more things. Supports auto decompression.

Thanks to https://github.com/SciresM/FEAT and https://github.com/einstein95/dsdecmp for the base of the decompression code.
